**LeetQuiet** is a lightweight browser extension for LeetCode that helps you stay focused by hiding spoilers like  
**solutions** and **difficulty levels**, encouraging you to think independently before seeking help.


## Why Use LeetQuiet?

Solving LeetCode problems effectively requires focus, discipline, and a clear head.  
But letâ€™s be real. Once your brain sees a big red **"Hard"**, it starts negotiating an exit plan.

**LeetQuiet removes distractions and spoiler temptations**, helping you:

- Avoid being intimidated by the difficulty tag. Just read the problem and start thinking.
- Think independently before peeking at solutions.
- Build strong problem-solving muscles through effort, not shortcuts.
- Practice like itâ€™s a real interview. No hints, spoilers, or psychological traps.


## What Does It Do?

- **Hides the Solutions and Editorial tabs** on LeetCode problem pages.
- **Conceals the difficulty label** (Easy, Medium, Hard) and replaces it with a motivational message:  
  > *"Your Brain > The Solution Tab ðŸ§ ðŸ”¥"*
- **Removes all difficulty indicators** (colored dots, text, and filter/sort options) from the UI for a cleaner, spoiler-free experience.
- **Blocks direct access** to `/solutions` and `/editorial` URLs â€” shows a custom motivational "roast" page and a button to return to the problem.
- **Displays a toast notification** when the extension is updated, with a link to the changelog.

## Installation (Manual Method)

1. Download the latest `.zip` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/sathwikhbhat/leet-quiet/releases) section.  
   *(Look for a file like `leetQuiet-v1.2.0.zip`, not the source code ZIP.)*
2. Extract the `.zip` file to any folder.
3. Open Chrome (or any Chromium-based browser).
4. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar.
5. Enable **Developer mode** using the toggle in the top-right corner.
6. Click **Load unpacked** and select the extracted folder.
7. Thatâ€™s it â€” LeetQuiet is now active on LeetCode problem pages!

Alternatively, drag and drop the folder directly into the Extensions page.

## How It Works

LeetQuiet runs automatically on all LeetCode problem pages and uses a **MutationObserver** to monitor DOM changes.

It:
- Hides the **Solutions** and **Editorial** tabs.
- Replaces the **difficulty label** ("Easy", "Medium", "Hard") with:  
  > *"Your Brain > The Solution Tab ðŸ§ ðŸ”¥"*
- Removes all difficulty indicators (colored dots, text, and filter/sort options) from the UI.
- Redirects users from `/solutions` or `/editorial` URLs to a custom motivational page with a button to return to the problem:
  > *"Trying to be smart, aah!? Looks like you're trying to peek at the solutions... but we both know growth comes from the grind ðŸ§ ðŸ’ª"*
- Shows a toast notification when the extension is updated, with a link to the full changelog.


## Permissions Required

LeetQuiet only runs on `leetcode.com/*` and requires the `storage` permission to remember if you've seen the latest update notification.  
It does **not collect, store, or transmit** any personal data.


## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome** (and all Chromium-based browsers)
- **Firefox** (minimum version 109, via browser-specific settings)
