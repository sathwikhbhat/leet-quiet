**LeetQuite** is a lightweight browser extension for LeetCode that helps you stay focused by hiding spoilers like  
**solutions** and **difficulty levels**, encouraging you to think independently before seeking help.


## Why Use LeetQuite?

Solving LeetCode problems effectively requires focus, discipline, and a clear head.  
But letâ€™s be realâ€”once your brain sees a big red **"Hard"**, it starts negotiating an exit plan.

**LeetQuite removes distractions and spoiler temptations**, helping you:

- Avoid being intimidated by the difficulty tag. Just read the problem and start thinking.
- Think independently before peeking at solutions.
- Build strong problem-solving muscles through effort, not shortcuts.
- Practice like itâ€™s a real interview. No hints, spoilers, or psychological traps.


## What Does It Do?

- **Hides the Solutions and Editorial tabs** on LeetCode problem pages.
- **Conceals the difficulty label** (Easy, Medium, Hard) and replaces it with a motivational message.
- **Blocks direct access** to `/solutions` and `/editorial` URLs â€” redirects you back with a warning.

## Installation (Manual Method)

1. Download the latest `.zip` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/sathwikhbhat/leet-quite/releases) section.  
   *(Look for a file like `leetQuite-v1.1.0.zip`, not the source code ZIP.)*
2. Extract the `.zip` file to any folder.
3. Open Chrome (or any Chromium-based browser).
4. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar.
5. Enable **Developer mode** using the toggle in the top-right corner.
6. Click **Load unpacked** and select the extracted folder.
7. Thatâ€™s it â€” LeetQuite is now active on LeetCode problem pages!

Alternatively, drag and drop the folder directly into the Extensions page.

## How It Works

LeetQuite runs automatically on all LeetCode problem pages and uses a **MutationObserver** to monitor DOM changes.

It:
- Hides the **Solutions** and **Editorial** tabs.
- Replaces the **difficulty label** ("Easy", "Medium", "Hard") with:  
  > *"Your Brain > The Solution Tab ðŸ§ ðŸ”¥"*
- Redirects users from `/solutions` or `/editorial` URLs back to the problem page with an alert:
  > *"No peeking at solutions! Redirecting you..."*


## Permissions Required

LeetQuite only runs on `leetcode.com/problems/*`.  
It does **not collect, store, or transmit** any data.
