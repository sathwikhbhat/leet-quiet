**LeetQuite** is a lightweight browser extension for LeetCode that helps you stay focused by hiding spoilers like
solutions and difficulty levels, encouraging you to think independently before seeking help.

## Why Use LeetQuite?

Solving LeetCode problems effectively requires focus, discipline, and a clear head.
But let's be real, the moment you see a big red **"Hard"** label, your brain starts negotiating an exit plan.

LeetQuite removes distractions and spoiler temptations, helping you:

- Avoid being intimidated by difficulty tag. Just read the problem and start thinking
- Think independently before peeking at solutions
- Build strong problem-solving muscles through effort, not shortcuts
- Practice like you interview. No hints, spoilers, or psychological traps

## What does it do?

- **Hides the Solutions and Editorial tabs** on LeetCode problem pages. No more temptation to peek.
- **Conceals the difficulty label** (Easy, Medium, Hard) and replaces it with a motivational message.
- **Blocks direct access** to the solutions/editorials pages. If you try, it redirects you back with a warning.

## Installation

1. Download the latest `.zip` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/sathwikhbhat/leet-quite/releases) section.  
   *(Look for a file like `leetQuite-v1.1.0.zip`, not the source code files.)*
2. Extract the `.zip` file to any folder on your computer.
3. Open Chrome (or any Chromium-based browser).
4. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar.
5. Enable **Developer mode** using the toggle in the top-right corner.
6. Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder where you extracted the extension.
7. Thatâ€™s it! LeetQuite is now active and will run automatically on LeetCode problem pages.

You can also drag and drop the folder directly into the extensions page.

## How It Works

- Automatically runs on **LeetCode problem pages**.
- Uses a **MutationObserver** to detect and hide distractions in real-time:
  - Hides the **Solutions** and **Editorial** tabs if they appear.
  - Replaces the **difficulty label** ("Easy", "Medium", "Hard") with a motivational message:  
    *"Your Brain > The Solution Tab ðŸ§ ðŸ”¥"*
- If the user tries to visit a **solutions** or **editorial** page directly:
  - They are **redirected** back to the problem description.
  - A short alert is shown: *"No peeking at solutions! Redirecting you..."*

## Permissions Required
